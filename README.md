🏗️ Data Warehouse and Analytics Project

Welcome to the Data Warehouse and Analytics Project repository! 🚀
This project demonstrates a complete data warehousing and analytics solution — from ingesting raw data to generating business insights. Designed as a portfolio project, it showcases real-world practices in data engineering, modeling, and analytics.

🏗️ Data Architecture

This project follows the Medallion Architecture (Bronze, Silver, Gold) model for data processing and management:

Bronze Layer: Stores raw data as-is from the source systems (ERP, CRM).

Silver Layer: Cleansed, standardized, and enriched data ready for analysis.

Gold Layer: Business-ready, modeled data (Star Schema) for BI and analytics.
